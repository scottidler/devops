## Description
An engineering organization will avoid vendor lock-in when possible.

## Rationale
It is important to have flexibility to change tools, technology, etc as business priorities and direction are altered.  Building solutions and software that is tightly coupled to a particular vendor's application and features can limit future flexibility.  We should resist making these decisions and only do so when there is a significant advantage to do so.

## Implication
An engineering organization will have to document and make the case whenever vendor lock-in is accepted.  There are many good examples of when vendor lock-in is the right call, An engineering organization will simply make the case for it when chosen.

## Principles
* [Continuous](../design-principles/continuous.md) because this is an iterative process and unintended lock-in can happen over time with small changes.
