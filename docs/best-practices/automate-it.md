# Automate IT
![automate-it](../../images/automate-it.jpg)

## Description
Most engineering organizations are ripe with opportunities to automate. Engineers should do so by starting with the low hanging fruit, especially repetitive manual tasks. The goal is to automate all the things.

## Rationale
With all the processes, functions and tasks we do, there are too many opportunities for mistakes. We should automate any and all tasks that are done more than once. Spending time upfront getting some piece of automation in place will pay dividends in the long run. Even if there are bugs that cause errors early on, eventually they will be fixed and the automation will produce the same result every time, and at a velocity that an engineer will not and should not match. Tasks that are already automated could be sped up even further by promoting them to  Self-service tools.

## Implication
Engineers will have to be careful to make sure the process is a good candidate for automation prior to beginning work. With all of the automation being written all of the time, it will be important to have approved programming languages, coding standards, code reviews and testing. This will also move the engineer's thought process to higher level, considering the best ways to automate our important processes.

## Principles
* [Automated](../design-principles/automated.md) because this all about automating IT.
* [Readable](../design-principles/readable.md) because well written code can be some of the best explanations and documentation of a process.
* [Measurable](../design-principles/measureable.md) because it is relatively easy to instrument code once you have automated a process to get good metrics.
* [Self-service](../design-principles/self-service.md) because we can take our automation to the next level by making the most important self-service enabled.
