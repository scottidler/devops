# Prefer Open Source
![prefer-open-source](../../images/prefer-open-source.png)
## Description
An engineering organization will prefer Open-source solutions whenever possible.

## Rationale
There are benefits to using open-source software beyond the importance of cost.  Open-source projects often have large communities around the use, documentation and ongoing development of the project.  This means it is often easier to get help with issues, as well as possible to file issues to have bugs fixed or new features added.  Additionally, open-source projects tend use one another and integrate functionality of other open-source projects.  Security issues are often found earlier and fixed faster than closed-source software.

## Implication
While this practice advocates for considering open-source when all things are equal, it also true that there may be good reasons to not choose the open-source solution.  An engineering organization will merely consider any and all options, especially the open-source ones.

## Principles
* [Culture](../design-principles/culture.md) because the culture of the open-source world is very good at improving the software, improve documentation, asking and answering questions about how to use appropriately, etc.
* [Collaborative](../design-principles/collaborative.md) because open-source is all about working together to share projects and learn from one another while improving products that deliver real value for those who use them.
