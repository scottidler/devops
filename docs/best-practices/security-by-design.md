# Security By Design
![security-by-design](../../images/security-by-design.jpg)
## Description
An engineering organization will setup machines, services, write code, etc with security in mind from the beginning, rather than try to address it after.

## Rationale
Developers and administrators are constantly forced to rethink their strategies on application securityâ€”adding safeguards as an afterthought is clearly no longer acceptable. Security must be a priority right from the start, beginning with the design process. With the amount of technology that we must maintain

## Implication
We should follow [Mozilla Security Principles](https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Security/Fundamentals/Security_Principles) when ever we create or add new tech into our environment. We should challenge any behavior that attempts to not do this.  Building within our security principles from the start will protect the organization's interests better, be easier to maintain, and show leadership on how to take security and privacy seriously.

## Principles
* [Holistic](../design-principles/holistic.md) because security affects all parts, phases of the product.
* [Culture](../design-principles/culture.md) because a good culture with security in mind improves outcomes.
