##Description
An engineering organization will avoid shortcuts that create technical debt, invest time to clean it up, and practice stewardship of machines, repositories, and source code.
## Rationale
Even the most mature organizations will generate tech debt as the systems they setup and code they write ages.  Eventually new directions or features will put stress on these systems.  Additionally, sometimes shortcuts are taken that generate even more tech debt.  The goal should be then to constantly be paying down this debt because it will inevitably accrue over time.
## Implication
An engineering organization will plan for and allocate time for engineers to pay down tech debt.  Individuals should practice the Boy Scout Rule and "always leave it cleaner than you found it."  Engineers should resist the temptation to take shortcuts that will generate tech debt.  If a short cut is taken, and follow up should be filed to address that issue in the near term.
## Principles
* [Readable](../design-principles/readable.md) because a system is more clear and easy to understand if tech debt is cleaned up.
* [Culture](../design-principles/culture.md) because to fight tech debt take a culture and commitment from the entire organization.
* [Collaborative](../design-principles/collaborative.md) because it is all about working together and collaborating and fighting tech debt is a collaborative effort.
* [Measurable](../design-principles/measureable.md) because it is possible to measure technical debt and keep metrics to stay informed.

## Examples
* The AppSvcs team currently is paying down some tech debt by decommissioning unused tech: DNS, Virtual Hosts, etc
* Migration of some websites to the cloud is creating some new tech debt
