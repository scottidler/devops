## Description
An organization should embrace and promote a culture of DevOps in all areas.

## Rationale
The backbone to any organization is its culture. Culture is enduring and pervasive, drives the beliefs and behaviors of its employees; in other words, it can be considered the “way of life” of an organization.

## Implication
For DevOps, we can focus on these key components:
* Learn to trust
* Understand motivations
* Eliminate blame
* Embrace smart failure
* Focus on bottlenecks and flow
* Eliminate unplanned work
* Be continuous
* Form dedicated, cross-functional teams
* Love transparency
* Build autonomy, mastery and purpose
