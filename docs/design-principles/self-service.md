# Self-service
![self-service](../../images/self-service.jpg)
## Description
Mozilla should have important processes fully automated, and if possible, as self-services to be faster.
## Rationale
Providing self-service systems allow for greater 'flow' through the system. Customers can get access to desired resources quicker than if they have to submit a request.
## Implication
To implement a self-service approach Mozilla will have to spend time to understand what are the common requests and how long they take to be implemented. So, in order to successfully implement the self-service approach, one needs to do a substantial amount of categorization and classification work.
