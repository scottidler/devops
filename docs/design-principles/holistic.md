# Holistic

## Description
Mozilla should support engineers with holistic views and responsibilities over all aspects of the software product while in service.
## Rationale
Holistic system thinking is about, as a member of an organisation, being able to think about how that problem can be solved in as many ways as possible, and taking into consideration every aspect of the product, the customer, the infrastructure and so forth.
Handoffs are wasteful. Anytime the responsibility for a software product changes hands, even under the best of circumstances, some knowledge is inevitably lost. Additionally, each transfer of knowledge and responsibility along the production chain lengthens your product’s lead-time, incurring unnecessary costs. These costs might include time spent in meetings and writing detailed documentation instead of coding, plus delays in realizing revenue and ROI the longer your product takes to get to your customers.
## Implication
In Lean manufacturing and lean software development, any step in the process that moves unfinished product from one stage to another, making no changes to bring it closer to the state for which a customer would pay, is considered “waste of transport” – one of the original 7 forms of waste. One of the key goals of Lean is to reduce such waste, and one way to eliminate these handoffs is by having one team responsible for all aspects of the product. From the inception of ideas all the way into production—including bug fixes and production support—have one team communicating and working together all the way, making Conway’s Law work for you.
