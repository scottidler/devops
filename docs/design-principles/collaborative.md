## Description
Mozilla should support cross-team collaborative efforts and teams work together to create org-wide solutions.
## Rationale
DevOps principles are all about helping teams work together. Barriers between teams slow down work, cause delays, and will ultimately cost a business money.
##Implication
Collaboration is the key to effective teamwork – and the key to enabling collaboration lies in an organisation’s culture. This is especially true given the distributed nature of many teams today. More and more, we see remote workers and teams operating not just in different locations, but in different timezones. It means communication can rapidly become a challenge. By bringing teams together, you align their goals, tools.
