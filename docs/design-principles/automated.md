## Description
Mozilla should automate everything that is a recurring process or task.
## Rationale
Processes are the enemy of fast value delivery, high productivity, and safety. But automation is not just about saving time. It also enables the creation of repeatable environments and processes, which are self-documenting and, therefore, easier to understand, improve, secure, and audit.
## Implication
Automation facilitates faster learning and response to market demand and customer feedback. Builds, testing, deployments and packaging that are automated improve the reliability of process that can be made routine.
