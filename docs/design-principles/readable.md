 # Readable
![readable](../../images/readable.jpg)
## Description
Mozilla should write code, documentation, etc that is easy to read and reason about. It should be easy for the reader to create the mental model of the system in question.
## Rationale
Documentation, comments and especially code (even Infrastructure As Code) is read many more times than it is written. Therefore all such writing should be written with clarity in mind for the future reader. Poorly written code or documentation can mislead, confuse and slow down a reader from understanding the subject.
## Implication
Scrutiny should be given to all writing, documentation, comments and especially code so that the readability is as high as possible. Peer review can help with assuring a mature level of readability across all of the technologies Mozilla uses.
